title: (1991-09-07 6:46 PM) The Library
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

It's official. I //love// Hogwarts.

Seriously, after exploring for the better part of the last //two days,// I think I can conclusively say that this place is //totally awesome.//

While there are likely many reasons that Hogwarts is awesome, in this case I am referring to one in particular: the library.

//Holy smokes the library!//

I suppose I should start from the beginning.

I decided to dedicate this weekend to exploring the castle. After all, the original books seemed to imply that there was an awful lot to see in the castle.

As I was wandering, with no real idea of where I wanted to go, I stumbled across the (main) entrance to the library.

Being the massive bookworm that I am, I decided to abandon my exploration of the castle for the day in favor of wandering around the library instead.

<hr />

Coming in from the main entrance, the Hogwarts library seems, at first blush, to be a fairly ordinary library. Well, as ordinary as a library in a school teaching //magic// can be, anyway. A clear area by the door with a few tables for reading, and a desk behind which sits a librarian, waiting for students to check out books.

The only thing that might possibly seem out of the ordinary is a small table in a dusty, out-of-the-way corner of the library, tucked deep within it's lesser-used shelves.

Obviously I didn't see the table straight away, as that would be silly. It was only after at least an hour of wandering that I came across it.

Sitting on that dusty, out-of-the-way table was a stack of pamphlets, topped with an index card saying only "Take One."

The [[pamphlet|Hogwarts Library Welcome Pamphlet]] started with the following introduction:

The rest of the pamphlet following that introduction can be summarized as such:

{{Hogwarts Library Welcome Pamphlet: Summary}}

The pamphlet ends with a warning to any who dare to venture further into the depths of the Library. The end of the feasibly-mappable area of the Library is marked with a red line on the floor. Beyond that line, it says, you're on your own.

Honestly, I'm getting some Library of Babel vibes here. Excellent.
