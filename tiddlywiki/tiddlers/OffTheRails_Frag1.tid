Today's the day. Halloween.

I am, //I hope,// prepared for what today is likely to bring.

â€¦ Let's go over the plan, one more time.

Plan A: Prevent Hermione from partnering with Ron in Charms class, so that Ron doesn't get a chance to be an insensitive little //turd-nugget.//

Plan B: Track down Hermione after she flees to the bathroom, talk her out of the bathroom.

Plan C: Fight the Troll.
