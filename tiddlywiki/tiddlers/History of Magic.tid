title: History of Magic
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

History of Magic, as a class and as a general topic, is fairly self-explanatory.

It is also, unfortunately, taught by a teacher that is only slightly better than Severus Snape in that he doesn't verbally abuse his students.

Also, I'm not really interested in history in general.

Due to these facts, don't expect to read much about the topic from here.
